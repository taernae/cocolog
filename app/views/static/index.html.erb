	<p>Built entirely as a resource for MUD (text-based, real-time multiplayer games) players to share logs with each other, CocoLog strives to provide a comprehensive interface and suite of features to accompany logs posted here, most features having been added at the request of several MUD players. Currently, CocoLog readily supports only a few realms, but if you are a player or administrator and want yours added, please feel free to <em><a href="/contact">contact me</a></em> and I will gladly add it.</p>
